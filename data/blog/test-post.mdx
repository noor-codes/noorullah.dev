Whenever I work with Firebase, I always seem to run into small issues that can be very annoying (yet simple) to solve. When I tried to connect my Flutter application to a Firebase backend for one of my personal projects, I ran into some small issues that set me back some time. Because of this, I decided to write a simple and straightforward article showing you how to connect your Flutter application to a firebase backend for both IOS and Android. After this tutorial, you will be all set to add authentication, cloud Firestore, or any other Firebase feature you might want.

## Outline

```javascript
firebase_auth: ^0.14.0+5
cloud_firestore: ^0.12.9+4
```
