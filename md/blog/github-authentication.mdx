Back in December 2020, GitHub announced, it will no longer accept passwords to perform
git operations starting August 13th, 2021. What does it mean for you as a developer?

Developers won't be able to do Git operations with GitHub,
`pushing or pulling the code included` using passwords. Previously we had to type our
username and our password to let GitHub recognize us and let us do all kinds of git
operations from the terminal. After August 2021, It is deprecated and we will see
the following error/feedback message.

```shell
Support for password authentication was removed on August 13, 2021. Please use a personal
access token instead. remote: Please see
https://github.blog/2020-12-15-token-authentication-requirements-for-git-operations/
for more information.
```

### Why GitHub Deprecated Password for Git Operations?

Security, Security, and Security. When we used to do git operations, we had to provide
our GitHub username and password. The same password could be used to login into the
GitHub account, create, delete and update repositories. If our GitHub username and
password were accessed by a Hackers. They could do operations that can not be reversed
unless we reach out to GitHub like deleting a repository.

Imagine if you're password is leaked and you are the maintainer of a project that
is used by thousands of people. It is like losing a community you worked so hard for, for
many years is now lost in a few seconds. Or you are working on a secret project for a
company that will be launched soon and someone deletes everything, including your account?
The horror list just keeps going on and on.

These are some of the main issues why GitHub brought up the necessary changes to address
these problems and reduce the damage even if the inevitable things happen.
Remember:

> Nothing is perfectly secure on the web but we can drastically reduce the
> chances of getting into serious problems.

### There are two ways to Git Operation with GitHub using HTTPS and SSH?

1.  ** Personal Access Tokens (HTTPS): **
    If you are using HTTPS (Clone with HTTPS selected) to manage git operations,
    you must generate a token in your GitHub account settings, and **You can paste your
    Personal Access Token instead of your password.** It will successfully perform the
    git operations and you won't see any error message unless your token is expired or
    invalid.

    #### How do I generate Personal Access Token?

    First, Sign in to your GitHub Account

    <Image
      alt="GitHub Login"
      src="/blogs/github_authentication/login.png"
      width={393}
      height={549}
      placeholder="blur"
      blurDataURL="/blogs/github_authentication/login.png"
    />

    Then go to Settings.

    <Image
      alt="GitHub Settings"
      src="/blogs/github_authentication/settings.png"
      width={228}
      height={666}
      placeholder="blur"
      blurDataURL="/blogs/github_authentication/settings.png"
    />

    Then go to Developer Settings.

    <Image
      alt="Developer Settings"
      src="/blogs/github_authentication/dev-settings.png"
      width={282}
      height={805}
      placeholder="blur"
      blurDataURL="/blogs/github_authentication/dev-settings.png"
    />

    Then go to Personal Access Tokens and click Generate New Token.

    <Image
      alt="Generate Token"
      src="/blogs/github_authentication/generate-token.png"
      width={321}
      height={202}
      placeholder="blur"
      blurDataURL="/blogs/github_authentication/generate-token.png"
    />

    Once you clicked it, You will see this page.

    <Image
      alt="Generate Token Page"
      src="/blogs/github_authentication/generate-token-page.png"
      width={966}
      height={1878}
      placeholder="blur"
      blurDataURL="/blogs/github_authentication/generate-token-page.png"
    />

    Here you can name your token and provide a time when the token should be expired.
    Temporary tokens are recommended for better security. Then check what operations
    should be allowed using this token and hit `Generate token` button.

    <Image
      alt="Access Token"
      src="/blogs/github_authentication/token.png"
      width={945}
      height={173}
      placeholder="blur"
      blurDataURL="/blogs/github_authentication/token.png"
    />

    This is how you're token will look like. For security purposes, you can copy it
    only once from GitHub and it will be never shown to you again. Make sure you keep
    it secure and do not share it with anyone. Sharing a Personal Access Token is like
    sharing your password.

    If you don't know where you stored your token, you can immediately delete all of
    your tokens from GitHub and generate a new one instead.

    Personal Access Tokens are better than Passwords for git operations and it has
    many benefits such as:

    - ** Uniqueness:** Every token can be generated for a unique device that let us
      track where the access to the system was granted.

    - ** Revocable:** You can delete a token from your GitHub settings in case if it's
      leaked and do quick damage control. Tokens are revokable but passwords are not.
      They can only be changed.

    - ** Limited:** Tokens can be scoped, Meaning that when you generate a token,
      GitHub will ask you what operation that token will be able to do. This way you
      can manage how much access should be given to a token.

    - ** Random:** Unlike passwords that are a few words. Tokens are longer compared to
      passwords and they are randomly generated. Hackers can not guess what the token
      will look like. GitHub will use a secure algorithm to randomly generate all the
      tokens that provide many times better security compared to passwords.

    - ** Temporary:** It is recommended by GitHub to generate tokens with a limited
      time like 7 days, 30 days, or 90 days, after that time. the token will be
      automatically marked as invalid. We can also generate a token to never expire
      and it is just as scary and the passwords themselves which is not recommended
      but we can do that if we want to.

2.  ** Secure Socket Shell (SSH): **
    SSH is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely
    in an insecure environment. In simple words, when two computers want to exchange
    information. Hackers can sit between those computers and steal important information.
    SSH provides a secure connection using [cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography)
    to log into or contact a remote computer.

    To use SSH with GitHub, First, we need to generate a set of keys.
    On Mac or Linux we can run the following command in our terminal to generate the keys.
    If you are on Windows, You can use
    [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)

    ```shell
    ssh-keygen -t rsa
    ```

    `ssh-keygen` command is used to generate the keys and `-t` flag is used to specify
    which algorithm should be used to generate the keys. In this case, the name of the
    algorithm is `rsa` [For more information about RSA Algorithm](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)>)

    Output:

    ```shell
    Generating public/private rsa key pair.
    Enter file in which to save the key (/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa):
    Enter file in which to save the key (/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub):
    ```

    The system will ask where to save both the private and public keys.
    The default location is located:

    ```shell
    /home/your_user_name_goes_here/.ssh/id_rsa
    /home/your_user_name_goes_here/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    ```

    ```shell
    Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
    Enter same passphrase again:
    ```

    In this stage you can choose a passphrase or password, highly recommended for
    extra security but you can leave it empty as well. Once you hit enter

    A random image will be printed to the console along with other details like this

    ```shell
    +---[RSA 3072]----+
    |             . -*|
    |             .B*X|
    |           . =G==|
    |            o.++ |
    |        S..  +   |
    |       + oo +    |
    |      o = .o F . |
    |     . o *..B =  |
    |     .o.o +o.*.  |
    +----[SHA256]-----+
    ```

    At this stage, you have successfully managed to generate a public and private key.

    - **Private Key:** The private key always stays on your computer and should never be
      shared with anyone, this is how it looks like:

    ```shell
      -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

      -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

    ```

    - **Public Key:** The public key is added to your GitHub account and
      this is how it looks like:

    ```shell
    ssh-rsa AAAA3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAACAQC2EMTW9TNcOrkcDiw
    CrpqdLdp1DnuKfrz4Ba5eHCyONA5yG5R6hvbyPN08/3y4UcIQN8ohc

    cG5rYkjIKdb0SZpOIIOQ==noorullah@linux
    ```

    **Next** we have to go to `.ssh` folder and open `id_rsa.pub` file and
    copy the key. If you can't see the folder, It's because it's hidden by default.
    Here is the path to the folder where `id_rsa.pub` file is located.

    ```shell
    /home/your_user_name_goes_here/.ssh
    ```

    Or we can type this command to print the public key to the terminal.

    ```shell
    cat /home/your_user_name_goes_here/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    ```

    You will see your public key on your terminal, copy all of it and go to your GitHub
    account settings. Select `SSH and GPG keys`

    <Image
      alt="SSH Settings"
      src="/blogs/github_authentication/ssh-settings.png"

      height={733}
      placeholder="blur"
      blurDataURL="/blogs/github_authentication/ssh-settings.png"
    />

    Click `New SSH-Key`

    <Image
      alt="Add SSH Key"
      src="/blogs/github_authentication/add-ssh-key.png"
      width={1008}
      height={535}
      placeholder="blur"
      blurDataURL="/blogs/github_authentication/add-ssh-key.png"
    />

    `Title` field is used to name your key. Feel free to choose whatever name you like
    and then in the `Key` field, paste your public key and click `Add SSH key` button.
    If things went well, this is how it looks like!

    <Image
      alt="SSH Key Looks Like"
      src="/blogs/github_authentication/ssh-key-look.png"
      width={963}
      height={343}
      placeholder="blur"
      blurDataURL="/blogs/github_authentication/ssh-key-look.png"
    />

    If you notice, the Key icon is gray, and it also says, `Never used`. Let's use SSH
    to see if our setup is working or not.

    Go to your favorite private repository you own and then click `Code`

    <Image
      alt="Clone with SSH"
      src="/blogs/github_authentication/clone-ssh.png"
      width={486}
      height={313}
      placeholder="blur"
      blurDataURL="/blogs/github_authentication/clone-ssh.png"
    />

    Make sure you have selected `SSH`. **Not `HTTPs` or `GitHub CLI`** and then click
    the copy button.

    Go to your terminal and type `git clone` hit space and paste the command you just
    copied like this.

    ```shell
    git clone git@github.com:Noorullah-Ahmadzai/noorullah.dev.git
    ```

    If the clone went well, This is how the SSH-Key should look like once you refresh
    the page.

    <Image
      alt="SSH Key Verified"
      src="/blogs/github_authentication/ssh-key-verified.png"
      width={946}

      placeholder="blur"
      blurDataURL="/blogs/github_authentication/ssh-key-verified.png"
    />

    **Yeaaaaah!** The color of the key is green now and the text shows it was recently
    used. This means our SSH configuration was successful.

    Behind the scene when we do git operations. Git will establish communication over SSH
    with GitHub and check if these two computers can communicate. If Yes, The operations
    will be carried out without asking you for passwords or tokens. It's completely automatic.

    There is also GitHub CLI which was recently introduced by GitHub.

**Note:** Passwords do and will continue to be used for loging into your GitHub account
on the web or mobile apps but it will no longer work for git operations such as Pushing or
Pulling the code because we do git operations more frequently and submitting our password
for each git operation is just too risky but we login into our account on the web once in
a while and stay logged longer time before we type our password again.

### Conclusion

Love it or hate it. GitHub and all other websites around the world encourage their users
to help them secure their users' accounts. GitHub provides 2 great methods for all git
operations and as developers, we need to have the necessary precaution in place to
avoid unauthorized access to our accounts.

Using Personal Access Tokens or Secure Socket Shell (SSH) We can drastically improve the
security of our GitHub Accounts.

I enjoy using SSH which automatically handles authentication and security behind
the scene with no effort except the initial setup that takes less than a minute.
Hope you enjoyed the article. Let me know what you think on social media.
